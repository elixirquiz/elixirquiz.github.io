  <h2><a href="2014-08-23-heightmap.html">Heightmap</a></h2>
  <p>Welcome to the third installment of Elixir Quiz. This week we will be creating heightmaps.</p>
<h3>About Heightmaps</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap">height map</a> is a system for storing terrain data. Height maps are typically stored as grayscale raster images, in which darker pixels are at a lower height than lighter pixels.</p>
<p>Another method involves storing separate levels of detail in separate colour channels. Large grained terrain changes may be stored in the red channel, medium grained terrain changes in the green channel, and fine grained changes in the blue channel.</p>
<p>Height maps are popular in video games, for storing terrain data. They are heavily used in video games that take advantage of procedural content generation. These games, such as <a href="http://minecraft.net">Minecraft</a>, make use of these techniques to ensure that every game that a person plays is different.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<blockquote><p>Write a program that takes a single number (A) as input, and produces a randomly generated heightmap in an AxA grid. Output can take any form, such as ascii or a bitmap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The choice of algorithm is up to you. Some algorithms that are commonly used are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond-square_algorithm">the diamond-square algorithm</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise">the perlin noise algorithm</a>.</p>
<h3>Example Output</h3>
<p><img src="assets/img/Heightmap.png" alt="Heightmap"/></p>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>The Heightmap quiz runs from Saturday August 23rd 2014 until Friday August 30th, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a>. For short solutions, you can put the code directly into your comment in the quiz thread.</p>
<p>For larger solutions, please host your code elsewhere and link to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com">GitHub gists</a> can be useful for hosting your solutions, but anywhere is fine.</p>
<h3>Example solutions</h3>
<p>After the quiz period ends on August 30th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a></p>

  <h2><a href="2014-08-16-run-length-encoding.html">Run Length Encoding</a></h2>
  <p>Welcome to the second installment of Elixir Quiz. This week we will be tackling a data compression algorigthm, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding">Run Length Encoding</a>.</p>
<h3>About Run Length Encoding</h3>
<p>Run length encoding is a compression algorithm that takes runs of sequential items in a series of data points, replacing that run with a single instance of the data point and the number of elements in that run.</p>
<p>This compression algorithm can be fairly efficient for some types of data. For example bitmap images can be greatly reduced by using this method, however it would be a poor choice for English language text, since it’s uncommon for a charater to be repeated more than twice. This would be extremely inefficient as most words would double in length, such as <code class="inline">horse</code>, which becomes <code class="inline">h1o1r1s1e1</code>.</p>
<p>Historically, RLE has been used to encode bitmap images in Windows 3.x. It was not a commonly used format, however it was used as the format of the startup screen. The algorithm is also used by fax machines, since the data they send is largely whitespace with small amounts of text on the page.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>Create a program that takes a single string as input, and returns the run length encoded value.</p>
<blockquote><p>Given a string of uppercase characters in the range A-Z, replace runs of sequential characters with a single instance of that value preceded by the number of items in the run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For example, if would take the sequence <code class="inline">JJJTTWPPMMMMYYYYYYYYYVVVVVV</code> the output would look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>3J2T1W2P4M9Y6V</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this instance, we’ve compressed a 27 character string down to 14 characters</p>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>The Run Length Encoding quiz runs from Saturday August 16th 2014 until Friday August 22nd, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a>. For short solutions, you can put the code directly into your comment in the quiz thread.</p>
<p>For larger solutions, please host your code elsewhere and link to it.</p>

  <h2><a href="2014-08-11-fizzbuzz.html">FizzBuzz</a></h2>
  <p>Welcome to the first ever Elixir Quiz problem. This week we will be tackling the classic interview question, FizzBuzz.</p>
<h3>About FizzBuzz</h3>
<p>I first heard about this problem several years ago while reading <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">a blog post on Coding Horror</a>. Since then I, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Other_uses">as well as many other programmers I am sure</a>, have used the problem to start learning new languages, as code kata, and as interview questions.</p>
<p>The problem is often chosen as an interview question as it is quite simple to implement, either as hand written psudocode or executable code. This makes it a good choice to filter out candidates who have little to no programming experience.</p>
<p>Since some of us will be using <a href="http://elixirquiz.github.io">Elixir Quiz</a> to take our first steps into the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> language, it makes sense to start with something simple and well understood.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>The FizzBuzz problem is fairly straight forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>Print the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with the word Fizz and multiples of 5 with the word Buzz. For numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, replace the number with the word FizzBuzz.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for example, 1 to 15 would look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>The FizzBuzz quiz runs from Saturday August 9th 2014 until Friday August 15th, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a>. For short solutions, you can put the code directly into your comment in the quiz thread.</p>
<p>For larger solutions, please host your code elsewhere and link to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com">GitHub gists</a> can be useful for hosting your solutions, but anywhere is fine.</p>
<h3>Example solutions</h3>
<p>We got 3 solutions for this problem. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/elixirquiz/comments/2d18d1/20140809_fizzbuzz/cjlj8q7">im_pragdave</a>
</li>
<li><a href="https://gist.github.com/behe/4dd260a65e81132a3d90">@jlind</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Two of the solutions involved pattern matching; Defining a function with 4 separate guard clauses to determine what string should be returned when a number is divisible by 15, 5, 3, or none of those.</p>
<pre><code>def transform(value) when rem(value, 15) == 0, do: &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;
def transform(value) when rem(value, 3) == 0, do: &quot;Fizz&quot;
def transform(value) when rem(value, 5) == 0, do: &quot;Buzz&quot;
def transform(value), do: value</code></pre>
<p>With the <code class="inline">transform/1</code> function defined, both solutions took a range of numbers and mapped it to this function.</p>
<pre><code>def up_to(n) do
  1..n
  |&gt; Enum.to_list
  |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;transform/1)
  |&gt; Enum.join &quot; &quot;
end</code></pre>
<p>The other solution took a different approach, using two cycling Streams, zipping them, and transforming the result into the correct value using <code class="inline">Stream.with_index/1</code>.</p>
<pre><code>defmodule FizzBuzz do

  @doc &quot;&quot;&quot;
  Print the FizzBuzz sequence from 1 to `n`

  ## Example

      iex&gt; FixxBuzz.up_to 20
      1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 Fizz Buzz 16 17 Fizz 19 Buzz
  &quot;&quot;&quot;

  def up_to(n) do
    fizzbuzz_stream |&gt; Enum.take(n) |&gt; Enum.join |&gt; IO.puts
  end

  @doc &quot;&quot;&quot;
  Return a stream of FizzBuzz values
  &quot;&quot;&quot;
  def fizzbuzz_stream do
    threes = Stream.cycle [ nil, nil, &quot;Fizz &quot; ]
    fives  = Stream.cycle [ nil, nil, nil, nil, &quot;Buzz &quot; ]
    Stream.zip(threes, fives) |&gt; Stream.with_index |&gt; Stream.map(&amp;speak/1)
  end

  defp speak({{nil,  nil},  n}), do: &quot;#{n+1} &quot;
  defp speak({{fizz, buzz}, _}), do: &quot;#{fizz}#{buzz}&quot;

end</code></pre>
