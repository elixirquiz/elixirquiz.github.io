  <h2><a href="2014-10-04-virtual-pet.html">Virtual Pet</a></h2>
  <p>Welcome to the ninth edition of Elixir Quiz. This week we are creating a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_pet">virtual pet</a>.</p>
<h3>What is a virtual pet?</h3>
<p>Virtual pets were huge in the 90â€™s. I remember owning a few, most of which involved a game embedded in a keychain. The game revolved around keeping the pet alive by feeding it, cleaning up after it, and ensuring it got enough sleep.</p>
<p>The toys quickly became popular and gained more advanced features, to the point where the pets could interact with each other. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon">Entire franchises</a> were created around these toys, including television shows, video games, plush toys, and trading card games in addition to the pets themselves.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<blockquote><p>Create a virtual pet game in which a player must keep the toy alive for the longest possible time. The pets health should be affected by properties such as <code class="inline">hunger</code>, <code class="inline">cleanliness</code> and <code class="inline">happyness</code>. The player should be able to take actions to improve any of these areas.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You can use this problem as a chance to investigate <a href="http://www.theerlangelist.com/2013/01/actors-in-erlangelixir.html">the actor model</a>. The <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/1.html">Elixir Getting Started guide</a> covers these topics well, including <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix_otp/2.html">Agents</a> and the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/getting_started/mix_otp/3.html">GenServer</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>The virtual pet quiz runs from Saturday October 4th 2014 until Friday October 10th, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a>. As always, you can host your code anywhere (like <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gists</a>), or post your solution directly into the subreddit post.</p>
<h3>Example solutions</h3>
<p>After the quiz period ends on October 10th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a></p>

              Each week a new post will appear, which will contain a new programming challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can participate by solving the problem in Elixir, and then posting a link to your soluton in the
              problem thread <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">on our subreddit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solutions to some problems may be obvious, but half the fun is solving problems in unexpected
              ways.
