  <h2><a href="2014-12-13-2048-game.html">2048 Game</a></h2>
  <p>Welcome to the seventeenth edition of Elixir Quiz. This week we will be
creating our own version of the game, 2048.</p>
<h3>The 2048 Game</h3>
<p><a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/">2048</a> is a game that was created in
2014 by developer <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli">Gabriele Cirulli</a>, and is
reminiscent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_puzzle">Sliding Puzzle games</a>.</p>
<p>The game is played on a 4x4 grid, which is initially empty except for 2 randomly
selected tiles, which have either a 2 or a 4 value in it. Players play the game
by pushing all of the tiles in a specified direction; up, down, left or right.</p>
<p>When tiles with matching values come into contact, they merge into one (the one furthest in the
direction that was specified). The value of this new tile is the combined value
of the tiles. After each turn, a new tile (either a 2 or a
4) is generated in one of the free spaces.</p>
<p>The player wins by creating a tile with the value 2048, and loses if the board
is filled with tiles and no more moves are available.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<blockquote><p>Create the game of 2048. You can simply use the command line for output, or
build a web application if youâ€™re feeling ambitious.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>The 2048 quiz runs from Saturday December 13th 2014 until Friday December 19th, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post a link to the code on Twitter, and mention <a href="https://twitter.com/elixir_quiz">@elixir_quiz</a>. As always, you can host your code anywhere (like <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gists</a>).</p>
<h3>Example solutions</h3>
<p>After the quiz period ends on December 19th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted on Twitter.</p>

              Each week a new post will appear, which will contain a new programming challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can participate by solving the problem in Elixir, and then posting a link to your soluton in the
              problem thread <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">on our subreddit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solutions to some problems may be obvious, but half the fun is solving problems in unexpected
              ways.
