  <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the eleventh edition of Elixir Quiz. This week we will be encrypting a piece of text using a simple Caesar Cipher.</p>
<h3>What is a Caesar Cipher</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar Cipher</a> is one of the simplest encryption methods.</p>
<p>It is named after the famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Roman general and statesman Julius Caesar</a>. Caesar used the technique in his reign as Roman general, in which he used a cipher with a left-shift of 3 to hide the contents of his military messages.</p>
<p>Another famous Caesar Cipher is known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">ROT13</a>, in which the text is shifted by 13 characters. This was popular in the early days of the internet, to hide spoilers on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> forums.</p>
<p>The cipher is extremely insecure, as it is susceptible to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis">frequency analysis</a> attacks.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<blockquote><p>Create a function that takes a piece of plain text (either in a string, or as a path to a file), as well as a number, and performs a shift of that many places on the text.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>As a stretch goal, see if you can reduce the time taken to encrypt large pieces of text by encrypting sections of it in parallel.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>The Caesar Cipher quiz runs from Saturday October 18th 2014 until Friday October 24th, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a>. As always, you can host your code anywhere (like <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gists</a>), or post your solution directly into the subreddit post.</p>
<h3>Example solutions</h3>
<p>After the quiz period ends on October 24th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a></p>

              Each week a new post will appear, which will contain a new programming challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can participate by solving the problem in Elixir, and then posting a link to your soluton in the
              problem thread <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">on our subreddit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solutions to some problems may be obvious, but half the fun is solving problems in unexpected
              ways.
