  <h2>Tic Tac Toe part 1: The Game</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the fourteenth edition of Elixir Quiz. This week we will be starting another multi-week project in which we create a multi player game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Tic Tac Toe</a>.</p>
<p>In previous weeks we built our first multi-week project, where we <a href="http://elixirquiz.github.io/2014-08-30-poker-part-1-a-deck-of-cards.html">completed</a> <a href="http://elixirquiz.github.io/2014-09-06-poker-part-2-finding-a-winner.html">the</a> <a href="http://elixirquiz.github.io/2014-09-13-poker-part-3-making-decisions.html">poker</a> <a href="http://elixirquiz.github.io/2014-09-20-poker-part-4-playing-a-game.html">game</a>. The point of the poker game was to learn more about pattern matching. This time we’re building a much simpler game, so that we can focus on the multi-user party of the application, and learn more about <a href="http://learnyousomeerlang.com/what-is-otp">OTP</a>.</p>
<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe">Tic Tac Toe</a> is a traditional pen and paper game played by 2 players.</p>
<p>The game takes place on a 3x3 grid, with players taking turns placing their token (either an X or a O) in an available square. A winner is determined when one player places 3 tokens in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally. A draw is declared if all 9 squares are populated with tokens without a line of 3 existing for either player.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<blockquote><p>Create a project that allows a person to play a game of Tic Tac Toe against a computer player. The AI doesn’t need to be sophisticated, and can be as simple as choosing random squares to place it’s token.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Remember that we’re planning on expanding this into a larger, multi-user system. We will eventually want to have many different games running simultaneously, so having a game run as a process, with connected processes for each player may be a good idea.</p>
<p>For reference on how a miltiplayer game can hang together in an OTP application, check out Martin Schurrer’s <a href="http://www.confreaks.com/videos/4131-elixirconf2014-otp-in-production-the-nitty-gritty-details-of-game-servers">talk at ElixirConf 2014.</a></p>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>Part 1 of the Tic Tac Toe quiz runs from Saturday November 22nd 2014 until Friday November 28th, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post a link to the code on Twitter, and mention <a href="https://twitter.com/elixir_quiz">@elixir_quiz</a>. As always, you can host your code anywhere (like <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Github Gists</a>), or post your solution directly into the subreddit post.</p>
<h3>Example solutions</h3>
<p>After the quiz period ends on November 28th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted on Twitter.</p>

              Each week a new post will appear, which will contain a new programming challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can participate by solving the problem in Elixir, and then posting a link to your soluton in the
              problem thread <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">on our subreddit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solutions to some problems may be obvious, but half the fun is solving problems in unexpected
              ways.
