  <h2>FizzBuzz</h2>
  <p>Welcome to the first ever Elixir Quiz problem. This week we will be tackling the classic interview question, FizzBuzz.</p>
<h3>About FizzBuzz</h3>
<p>I first heard about this problem several years ago while reading <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/why-cant-programmers-program/">a blog post on Coding Horror</a>. Since then I, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Other_uses">as well as many other programmers I am sure</a>, have used the problem to start learning new languages, as code kata, and as interview questions.</p>
<p>The problem is often chosen as an interview question as it is quite simple to implement, either as hand written psudocode or executable code. This makes it a good choice to filter out candidates who have little to no programming experience.</p>
<p>Since some of us will be using <a href="http://elixirquiz.github.io">Elixir Quiz</a> to take our first steps into the <a href="http://elixir-lang.org">Elixir</a> language, it makes sense to start with something simple and well understood.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<p>The FizzBuzz problem is fairly straight forward.</p>
<blockquote><p>Print the numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with the word Fizz and multiples of 5 with the word Buzz. For numbers that are divisible by 3 and 5, replace the number with the word FizzBuzz.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for example, 1 to 15 would look like:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz Fizz 7 8 Fizz Buzz 11 Fizz 13 14 FizzBuzz</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>The FizzBuzz quiz runs from Saturday August 9th 2014 until Friday August 15th, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a>. For short solutions, you can put the code directly into your comment in the quiz thread.</p>
<p>For larger solutions, please host your code elsewhere and link to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com">GitHub gists</a> can be useful for hosting your solutions, but anywhere is fine.</p>
<h3>Example solutions</h3>
<p>After the quiz period ends on August 15th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a></p>

              Each week a new post will appear, which will contain a new programming challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can participate by solving the problem in Elixir, and then posting a link to your soluton in the
              problem thread <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">on our subreddit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solutions to some problems may be obvious, but half the fun is solving problems in unexpected
              ways.
