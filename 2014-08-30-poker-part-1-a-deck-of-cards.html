  <h2><a href="2014-08-30-poker-part-1-a-deck-of-cards.html">Poker part 1: A deck of cards</a></h2>
  <p>Welcome to the fourth installment of Elixir Quiz. This week, we embark on our first multi-week project, building a game of 5 card draw poker. This week we will be building the deck of cards.</p>
<h3>An introduction to 5 card draw</h3>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-card_draw">5 card draw</a> is one of the simplest variations of poker. It is the game that is most likely to have been played in people’s homes up until the rise in popularity of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_'em">Texas Hold’em</a>.</p>
<p>The game begins with each player being dealt 5 cards face down. After each player is dealt their cards, they then assess their initial hands. Players take turns discarding any of their cards and receiving replacements.</p>
<p>Players then compare their hands against one another to determine the winning hand.</p>
<p>For our first step, we will build ourselves a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_52-card_deck">deck of cards</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven’t explored testing with <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/ex_unit/ExUnit.html">ExUnit</a> yet, the poker project provides a great opportunity to start.</p>
<h3>The problem</h3>
<blockquote><p>Create a module that will allow us to create a shuffled deck of cards. The deck should contain the 52 cards included in a regular deck. How the cards and deck are represented are completely up to you.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Since we’re working with the cards this week, also ensure that you have a function to compare the value of 2 individual cards. Card values, in high -&gt; low order, are <code class="inline">Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How do I enter?</h3>
<p>The Poker part 1 quiz runs from Saturday August 30th 2014 until Friday September 5th, 2014.</p>
<p>To enter, just complete the problem and post the code to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a>. I’d suggest this week storing your project in a source control system, as we’ll be working on this for a few weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> can be useful for hosting your solutions, but anywhere is fine.</p>
<h3>Example solutions</h3>
<p>After the quiz period ends on September 5th, I will update this section and talk about some interesting solutions that were posted to <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">our subreddit</a></p>

              Each week a new post will appear, which will contain a new programming challenge.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can participate by solving the problem in Elixir, and then posting a link to your soluton in the
              problem thread <a href="http://reddit.com/r/elixirquiz">on our subreddit</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Solutions to some problems may be obvious, but half the fun is solving problems in unexpected
              ways.
